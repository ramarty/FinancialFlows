Banknotes issued by the Eurosystem are allocated to individual national central banks using a fixed coefficient, as explained in the section on <i>Monetary Statistics for Euro Area </i>in the introduction to <i>IFS</i>. Therefore, currency in circulation and its contribution to monetary base and broad money at national level have to be interpreted as notional amounts and not as currency effectively in circulation in the country.

The oMFIs sector includes deposit-taking corporations and money market funds. Deposit-taking corporations include credit institutions as defined by EU law, electronic money institutions that are principally engaged in financial intermediation in the form of issuing electronic money, and other financial institutions which are principally engaged in financial intermediation and whose business is to receive deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from institutional units, not only from MFIs (the degree of substitutability between the instruments issued by other MFIs and the deposits placed with credit institutions shall determine their classification as MFIs); and for their own account, at least in economic terms, to grant loans and/or make investments in securities.

Between March 5, 1990 and December 31, 1998, the market rate maintained within the EMS was applicable to all transactions.  Prior to January 1999, the market rate was the midpoint rate in the official market in Brussels. In January 1999, the Belgian franc became a participating currency within the Eurosystem, and the euro market rate became applicable to all transactions. In 2002, the franc was retired from circulation and replaced by euro banknotes and coins.

Therefore, currency in circulation and its contribution to monetary base and broad money at national level have to be interpreted as notional amounts and not as currency effectively in circulation in the country.

Since then, the Egyptian Pound is traded freely in a single exchange market with the authorities intervening to maintain the rate in a tight band against U.S. dollars.</p> <p>Egypt's exchange rate regimes prior to October 1991 are as follows: Until May 11, 1987, the <i>central bank pool, </i>which continues to exist, handled (1) on the receipts side, exports of petroleum, cotton, and rice; Suez Canal dues and Sumed pipeline royalties; and (2) on the payments side, imports of certain essential foodstuffs (including wheat, wheat flour, edible oils, tea, and sugar); insecticide and fertilizers; and specified public sector capital transactions. It covered all public sector external debt service payments except for service payments on suppliers' credits related to public sector capital goods imports. The <i>commercial bank pool, </i>which was formally closed in March 1988, received proceeds of workers' remittances, tourism, and exports not going through the central bank pool, while providing foreign exchange for public sector payments not covered by the central bank pool. In addition, transactions involving residents' holdings of foreign exchange deposits in free accounts with domestic banks were effected outside the banking system, and there also existed an unofficial market in Port Said (a free trade zone) and illegal street markets. The outside-banks markets shared common sources of supply with the commercial bank pool (workers' remittances and tourism) and satisfied demand by the private sector for exchange for both visible and invisible transactions.</p> <p>A <i>new bank foreign exchange market </i>(the new bank market), in which all authorized commercial banks and two travel agencies were permitted to operate, began operations on May 11, 1987. In opening the market, the authorities set the initial exchange rate to reflect the rates in the outside-banks markets; subsequently, the daily rate for the market has been determined de jure by a committee of representatives from eight participating banks on the basis of market supply, demand, and other factors as evolved by the committee. On the supply side, the new bank markets' resources are drawn mainly from workers' remittances, tourist expenditures, the purchase of foreign bank notes, and specified public and private sector export earnings. On the uses side, the new market is permitted to provide foreign exchange for specified public sector visible and invisible transactions, private sector imports, and certain private sector invisible payments primarily related to imports. Authorized banks are permitted to sell for private sector debt servicing up to 10 percent of their foreign exchange receipts, provided that the debtors' own foreign exchange accounts have been drawn down.</p> <p>Over 1987/88–1988/89, transactions through the central bank pool accounted for approximately two thirds and one fourth of merchandise exports and imports, respectively, and 40 percent of invisible transactions. Although the buying rate in the central bank pool was changed on August 15, 1989 from LE 0.7=US$1 to LE 1.1=US$1, the Central Bank established three subaccounts to shield most transactions in the pool from the rate change, and most transactions continue to be carried out effectively at the rate of LE 0.7 = US$1.</p> <p><i>Principal Rate </i>relates to the central bank fixed official rate through December 1978, the unified exchange rate from January 1979 through July 1981, and the central bank pool rate thereafter.</p> <p><i>Secondary Rate </i>relates to the parallel market exchange rate through December 1978, the official incentive buying rate established by the authorities that applies to exchange transactions by authorized banks from August 1981 through December 1984, the premium rate quoted at authorized banks from January 1985 through June 1986, the authorized commercial bank (flexible) rate from July 1986 through March 1988, and the new bank free market rate thereafter. The banks free market rate was established in May 1987 and gradually absorbed most transactions from the authorized banks rate until the latter was abolished in March 1988.</p> <p><i>Tertiary Rate </i>relates to transactions effected outside banks and can only be considered as indicative of the exchange rates at which such transactions take place.</p> <p>Since February 27, 1991, foreign exchange transactions were carried out through two markets, the primary market and the free market. Effective October 8, 1991, the primary market was eliminated, and all foreign exchange transactions are effected through the free market.</p> <p><b>International Liquidity:</b></p> <p><i>Gold </i>(<i>National Valuation</i>) (<i>line 1and</i>) is the U.S. dollar value of official holdings of gold, which is valued at the daily average of gold fixing in London during the preceding three months, less a discount of 25 percent or at 75 percent of its final fixing on the last working day in June, whichever is less.</p> <p><b>Central Bank:</b></p> <p>Consists of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) only. </p> <p>† Beginning in January 2004, data are based on a standardized report form (SRF) for central banks, which accords with the concepts and definitions of the IMF's <i>Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual</i> (<i>MFSM</i>).

The international reserves of Italy per the Eurosystem statistical definition at the start of the monetary union (January 1, 1999) in billions of U.S. dollars were as follows: <i>Total Reserves minus Gold, </i>$29,423; <i>Foreign Exchange, </i>$24,457; <i>SDR holdings, </i>$111; <i>Reserve Position in the Fund, </i>$4,314; <i>Other Reserve Assets, </i>$541; <i>Gold, </i>$23,991; <i>Gold (million fine troy ounces), </i>83.363 ounces. <i>Foreign Exchange (line 1d.d)</i>: Between March 1979 and December 1998, gold and foreign exchange excluded deposits at the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (EMCF), and holdings of European currency units (ECUs) issued against these deposits were included in <i>line 1d.d. Gold (Eurosystem Valuation) (line 1and): </i>Prior to January 1999, gold was valued according to national valuation practices, whereby gold was revalued quarterly on the basis of the average London market price in the preceding six months or the average price of the penultimate working day of the period, whichever was lower. From January 1999 onward, gold is revalued at the market price at the end of each month.

Therefore, currency in circulation and its contribution to monetary base and broad money at national level have to be interpreted as notional amounts and not as currency effectively in circulation in the country.

The oMFIs sector includes deposit-taking corporations and money market funds. Deposit-taking corporations include credit institutions as defined by EU law, electronic money institutions that are principally engaged in financial intermediation in the form of issuing electronic money, and other financial institutions which are principally engaged in financial intermediation and whose business is to receive deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from institutional units, not only from MFIs (the degree of substitutability between the instruments issued by other MFIs and the deposits placed with credit institutions shall determine their classification as MFIs); and for their own account, at least in economic terms, to grant loans and/or make investments in securities.

"","","Latvia","941","International Financial Statistics (IFS)","IFS","","","","","","","","","","Key statistical concepts"," <p>Data are denominated in euros for all available periods, unless otherwise stated. Latvia joined the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in January 2014. An irrevocably fixed factor for converting lats to euros was established at 0.702804 Latvian lats per euro.

Rates quoted by banks and moneychangers closely follow the Bank of Latvia rate. The official rate is pegged to the SDR. In January 2014, the euro, which has a market determined exchange rate, was adopted.</p> <p><b>International Liquidity:</b></p> <p>Beginning in January 2014, <i>Total Reserves minus Gold (line 1l.d) </i>and <i>Foreign Exchange (line.1d.d) </i>are defined in accordance with the Eurosystem's statistical definition of international reserves. <i>Gold (Eurosystem Valuation) (line 1and)</i> is revalued monthly at market prices. Gold reserves were valued at 175.50 lats per troy ounce April 28, 1997 - March 30, 1999. As of March 31, 1999, gold reserves are valued at market price. Memorandum data are provided on <i>Non-Euro Claims on Euro Area Residents and Euro Claims on Non-Euro Area Residents</i>.

The classifications of economic sectors and financial instruments used in the accounts are based on the ECB Regulation (ECB/2013/33) concerning the balance sheet of the monetary financial institutions (MFIs) sector. For a description of the accounts, including the difference between national and euro area-wide residency criteria, see the section on <i>Monetary Statistics for Euro Area </i>in the introduction to <i>IFS</i>.</p> <p>Data are based on a standardized report form (SRF) for central banks, which accords with the concepts and definitions of the IMF’s <i>Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual</i> (<i>MFSM</i>), 2000.

Banknotes issued by the Eurosystem are allocated to individual national central banks using a fixed coefficient, as explained in the section on <i>Monetary Statistics for Euro Area </i>in the introduction to <i>IFS</i>. Therefore, currency in circulation and its contribution to monetary base and broad money at national level have to be interpreted as notional amounts and not as currency effectively in circulation in the country.

The oMFIs sector includes deposit-taking corporations and money market funds. Deposit-taking corporations include credit institutions as defined by EU law, electronic money institutions that are principally engaged in financial intermediation in the form of issuing electronic money, and other financial institutions which are principally engaged in financial intermediation and whose business is to receive deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from institutional units, not only from MFIs (the degree of substitutability between the instruments issued by other MFIs and the deposits placed with credit institutions shall determine their classification as MFIs); and for their own account, at least in economic terms, to grant loans and/or make investments in securities.

As of August 1, 1996, the Bank of Mexico introduced a system for buying foreign exchange on the market, without abandoning its commitment to the floating exchange rate.

Central Bank indicative midpoint rate. Prior to January 1999, the official indicative rates for the U.S. dollar and other currencies were determined by the Bank of Portugal on the basis of market exchange rates data received by 12:00 p.m. from the main foreign exchange market-makers. These rates were a reference for bank bid-offer rates, which were freely determined. In January 1999, the escudo became a participating currency within the Eurosystem, and the euro market rate became applicable to all transactions. In 2002, the escudo was retired from circulation and replaced by euro banknotes and coins. For additional information, refer to the section on Exchange Rates in the introduction to <i>IFS </i>and the notes for the euro area page. <i>Real Effective Exchange Rates: </i>Prior to January 1998, calculations are based on a consumer price index that excludes rents.</p> <p><b>International Liquidity:</b></p> <p>Beginning in January 1999, <i>Total Reserves minus Gold (line 1l.d) </i>is defined in accordance with the Eurosystem's statistical definition of international reserves. The international reserves of Portugal per the Eurosystem statistical definition at the start of the monetary union (January 1, 1999) in billions of U.S. dollars were as follows: <i>Total Reserves minus Gold, </i>$9,087; <i>Foreign Exchange, </i>$8,273; <i>SDRs, </i>$135; <i>Reserve Position in the Fund, </i>$621; <i>Other Reserve Assets, </i>$60; <i>Gold, </i>$5,774 <i>Gold (million fine troy ounces), </i>20.089 ounces. <i>Foreign Exchange (line 1d.d): </i>Foreign exchange holdings of the Treasury Department of the government of Portugal are included in reserves <i>(line 1dbd)</i>.

Gold (Eurosystem Valuation) (line 1and)</i>:  Prior to January 1980, <i>Gold (Million Fine Troy Ounces) (line 1ad) </i>was valued at SDR 35 per ounce and converted into U.S. dollars at the U.S. dollar/SDR exchange rate <b>sa </b>on the <i>IFS </i>page for the United States. From January 1980 to December 1987, <i>line 1and </i>was revalued at 70 percent of the average price of gold in the London market during the second half of 1979. From January 1988 to November 1998, <i>line 1and </i>excluded deposits of gold. From January 1999 onward, <i>line 1and </i>is revalued at market prices at the end of each month. Gold swaps within <i>line 1and </i>are treated as repurchase transactions that do not affect the volume of gold held.  Memorandum data are provided on <i>Non-Euro Claims on Euro Area Residents </i>and <i>Euro Claims on Non-Euro Area Residents, </i>which represent positions as of the last Friday in each month.

Liabilities in the form of loans are included in deposits.</p> <p><i>Currency in Circulation</i> includes banknotes issued by the Eurosystem and allocated to the national central bank and coin issue by the central government. Banknotes issued by the Eurosystem are allocated to individual national central banks using a fixed coefficient, as explained in the section on <i>Monetary Statistics for Euro Area </i>in the introduction to <i>IFS</i>. Therefore, currency in circulation and its contribution to monetary base and broad money at national level have to be interpreted as notional amounts and not as currency effectively in circulation in the country. Coin issue of central governments is conventionally included in currency in circulation, with contra-entry recorded in <i>Other Items (Net)</i>.</p> <p>Trade credit/advances and settlement accounts are included in <i>Other Items (Net)</i> rather than as claims on and liabilities to the corresponding economic sectors.</p> <p>Further details on methodology are available on the European Central Bank website and in the ECB publication “Manual on MFI balance sheet statistics”.</p> <p>For selected data that are only available on a quarterly basis, monthly data are IMF estimates using linear extrapolation.</p> <p><b>Other Depository Corporations:</b> </p> <p>Comprises the aggregated accounts of all resident units part of the other monetary financial institutions (oMFIs) sector, defined in article 1(a) of ECB Regulation (ECB/2013/33) on the balance sheet of the MFIs sector, which also defines the classifications of economic sectors and financial instruments used in the accounts. The oMFIs sector includes deposit-taking corporations and money market funds. Deposit-taking corporations include credit institutions as defined by EU law, electronic money institutions that are principally engaged in financial intermediation in the form of issuing electronic money, and other financial institutions which are principally engaged in financial intermediation and whose business is to receive deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from institutional units, not only from MFIs (the degree of substitutability between the instruments issued by other MFIs and the deposits placed with credit institutions shall determine their classification as MFIs); and for their own account, at least in economic terms, to grant loans and/or make investments in securities.

The exchange rate of the commercial rand was determined in a managed floating system and applied to all current transactions. The financial rand applied to the local sale or redemption proceeds of South African securities and other investments in South Africa owned by nonresidents (other than former residents of South Africa), capital remittances by emigrants and immigrants, and approved outward capital transfers by residents. The exchange rate of the financial rand was determined freely by the supply and demand for financial rand balances. Beginning March 13, 1995, the government abolished the financial rand system and repealed all exchange control restrictions on the free convertibility and repatriation of the local sale proceeds on investments in South Africa owned by nonresidents. Thus, beginning March 13, 1995, a unitary exchange rate that applies to both current and capital transactions between residents and nonresidents is in effect.

Gold (Eurosystem Valuation) (line 1and)</i>: In December 1981, gold was revalued from US $42.22 per ounce to US $298 per ounce. From March 1979 to December 1998, excludes deposits of gold at the EMCF.  Prior to January 1999, <i>line 1and </i>was revalued based on the following formula: If the average market price for the calendar year (or the fourth quarter, if lower) was greater than 150 percent of the current book price, the book price was increased by an amount equal to the difference between the average market price and 150 percent of the book price. Conversely, if the book price was more than 80 percent of the average market price during any number of months since the last price adjustment, then the book price was lowered to 80 percent of the average market price for that period.  From January 1999 onward, gold is revalued at market prices at the end of each month.

Therefore, currency in circulation and its contribution to monetary base and broad money at national level have to be interpreted as notional amounts and not as currency effectively in circulation in the country.

This institutional separation reflects the fact that the ownership and purpose of the central government and Bank of England pools of foreign assets are different. The Exchange Equalization Account (EEA) holds the central government's foreign currency assets, owned by Her Majesty's Treasury but managed by the Bank of England acting as its agent.  The EEA was established in 1932 to provide a fund that could be used for &quot;checking undue fluctuations in the exchange value of sterling&quot; (Section 24 of the Finance Act 1932). Any U.K. government intervention in the foreign exchange market would therefore be conducted through the EEA. The Bank of England manages its own holdings of foreign assets and gold which mainly arise from the Bank's routine banking business with its customers, from its operations in the U.K. money markets, and from U.K. participation in the euro payment system, TARGET.  In accordance with the Chancellor of the Exchequer's letter of May 6, 1997 to the Governor of the Bank of England, the Bank may intervene in the foreign exchange market in support of its monetary policy objective. The Bank of England's holdings of foreign assets are, therefore, not considered by the U.K. authorities to be part of the U.K.'s international reserves. Data on the Bank of England's holdings of liquid foreign assets (including Gold) are shown for completeness under <i>Other Liquid Foreign Assets (line 1e.d).</i> Net TARGET related balances are included in <i>Other Liquid Foreign Assets (line 1e.d).</i></p> <p>From April 1979 to June 1999, international reserves were valued using parity exchange rates; non-dollar holdings were revalued each year at the average of their exchange rates against the U.S. dollar in the three months up to the end of March. This system was amended in April 1980 in that the U.S. dollar valuation on the last working day of March was used if that was lower than the three-month average.  The only exception to this was Gold for which a discount was also applied. Hence, beginning in April 1980, gold was valued at the lower of either the average of the London fixing price for the three months up to the end of March, less 25 percent, or at 75 percent of its final fixing price on the last working day in March.</p> <p><i>Banking Institutions: Foreign Assets (line 7a.d)</i> includes banking institutions' claims on foreign central monetary institutions (CMIs) and other nonresidents in the form of loans and advances, overdrafts, commercial bills, sterling denominated acceptances, and from end-1985, bonds issued by nonresidents. <i>Foreign Liabilities (line 7b.d)</i> includes banking institutions' liabilities to foreign CMIs, and other nonresidents.</p> <p>The data on external liabilities and claims are as reported by the Bank of England.</p> <p><b>Monetary Authorities:</b></p> <p>† Beginning in July 1999, consolidates the accounts of the Bank of England's Issue and Banking Departments, and central government functions relating to the issue of coin.

In addition, deposits included in broad money may be overstated due to the estimates to allocate these deposits to money holding sectors described in the note on the other depository corporations.</p> <p><i>Money (National Definitions):</i></p> <p><i>Monetary Base </i>comprises (1) total reserves, (2) required clearing balances and adjustments to compensate for float at Federal Reserve Banks, (3) the currency component of the money stock, and (4) for all quarterly reporters on the &quot;Report of Transaction Accounts, Other Deposits and Vault Cash&quot; and for all those weekly reporters whose vault cash exceeds their required reserves, the difference between current vault cash and the amount applied to satisfy current reserve requirements.

It is the rate banks charge each other for loans.</p> <p><i>Discount Rate (End of Period):</i></p> <p>Rate at which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York discounts eligible paper and makes advances to member banks. Establishment of the discount rate is at the discretion of each Federal Reserve bank but is subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors in Washington every fourteen days; these rates are publicly announced. Borrowing from a Federal Reserve bank is a privilege of being a member of the Federal Reserve system. Borrowing may take the form either of discounts of short-term commercial, industrial, and other financial paper or of advances against government securities and other eligible collateral; most transactions are in the form of advances. Federal Reserve advances to or discounts for member banks are usually of short maturity up to fifteen days. Federal Reserve banks do not discount eligible paper or make advanced to members banks automatically. Ordinarily, the continuous use of Federal reserve credit by a member  bank over a considerable period of time is not regarded as appropriate. The volume of discount is consequently very small. † Effective January 9, 2003, the rate charged for primary credit replaces that for adjustment credit. Primary credit, which is broadly similar to credit programs offered by many, which is broadly similar to credit programs offered by many other central banks, is made available by the Federal Reserve Bank for short terms as a backup source of liquidity to other depository corporations that are in sound financial condition.</p> <p><i>Federal Funds Rate:</i></p> <p>Weighted average rate at which banks borrow funds through New York brokers. Monthly rate is the average of rates of all calendar days, and the daily rate is the average of the rate on a given day weighted by the volume of transaction.</p> <p><i>Commercial Paper Rate:</i></p> <p>Rate on three-month commercial paper of nonfinancial firms. Rates are quoted on a discount basis and interpolated from data on certain commercial paper trades settled by the Depository Trust Company. The trades represent sales of commercial paper by dealers or direct issuers to investors.</p> <p><i>Treasury Bill Rate:</i></p> <p>Weighted average yield on multiple-price auctions of 13-week treasury bills. Monthly averages are computed on an issue-date basis. Beginning on October 28, 1998, data are stop yields from uniform-price auctions.</p> <p><i>Certificate of Deposit Rate:</i></p> <p>Average of dealer offering rates on nationally traded certificates of deposits.</p> <p><i>Lending Rate:</i></p> <p>Base rate charged by banks on short-term business loans. Monthly rate is the average of rates of all calendar days and is posted by a majority of the top 25 insured U.S. chartered commercial banks.</p> <p><i>Mortgage Rate:</i></p> <p>Contract rate on 30-year fixed-rate first mortgages.</p> <p><i>Government Bond Yield: Long-Term (line 61):</i></p> <p>Yield on actively traded treasury issues adjusted to constant maturities. Yield on treasury securities at constant maturity are interpolated by the U.S. Treasury from the daily yield curve. This curve, which relates the yield on a security to its time to maturity, is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded treasury securities in the over-the-counter market. These market yields are calculated from composites of quotations obtained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Medium-Term rate refers to three-year constant maturities.

On December 11, 1995, the official rate of the bolivar was devalued from 170 bolivares per U.S. dollar to 290 bolivares per U.S. dollar. Effective April 22, 1996 the exchange rate regime was changed to a managed float with full convertibility. On July 8, 1996 an exchange rate band system was introduced with a width of 7.5 percent each way around the central parity which moves according to the annual inflation target. Effective January 1, 2001, the exchange rate band was moved by 7.5 percent to set the central parity rate of the band to the actual level of the exchange rate. Effective February 13, 2002, the exchange rate regime was changed to a floating system. On February 4, 2003, the bolivar was fixed at Bs 1,598 per US$1 and, therefore, the exchange regime was reclassified to the category of conventional pegged arrangement. Effective February 9, 2004, the bolivar was devalued and fixed at Bs 1,918 per US$1. Effective March 3, 2005, the bolivar was fixed at Bs 2,147 per US$1.

"","","Euro Area","163","International Financial Statistics (IFS)","IFS","","","","","","","","","","Key statistical concepts"," <p>The original euro area member states are Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. Greece joined in January 2001, Slovenia in January 2007, Cyprus and Malta in January 2008, Slovak Republic in January 2009, Estonia in January 2011, Latvia in January 2014, and Lithuania in January 2015.</p> <p>The European Economic Community, established in 1958, formed the basis for European integration and creation of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) through a three-stage process. On July 1, 1990, the European Community entered Stage One of monetary union, which led to freedom of capital movements, increased cooperation among central banks, free usability of the European currency unit (ECU), and improvement of economic convergence among member states of the European Union (EU). The Maastricht Treaty, signed in February 1992, provided the legal basis for Stage Two, which began with the establishment of the European Monetary Institute (EMI). During Stage Two, the member states achieved greater economic convergence, enhanced coordination of monetary policies, and prohibited monetary financing of governments by central banks. The European Central Bank (ECB), successor to the EMI, was established on June 1, 1998, as part of Stage Two. Stage Three began on January 1, 1999 when the euro-the euro area currency unit-was introduced, the conversion rates for national currencies were irrevocably fixed, the new exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) became effective for two of the four EU countries that did not join the initial EMU, and the Eurosystem (the ECB and the euro area national central banks) began conducting a single monetary policy for the euro area. In 2002, euro banknotes issued by the Eurosystem and euro coins issued by the national authorities replaced the national currencies of the euro area countries. A description of the methodology and presentation of accounts for the euro area is presented in the introduction to <i>IFS. </i>† For monetary and balance of payments data, the euro area aggregated series follow a changing composition principle. That is, data for the euro area refers to its actual membership in the respective reference period. Thus, the accession of each member state, starting with Greece in 2001, created breaks in the time series.</p> <p><b>Standard Sources:</b></p> <p>European Central Bank</p> <p>Eurostat</p> <p><b>Exchange Rates:</b></p> <p><i>Market Rate (End of Period</i> and <i>Period Average):</i></p> <p>The euro was created on January 1, 1999 as the legal currency of the euro area countries, with an initial value established by setting one euro equal to one European currency unit (ECU), which was the accounting unit of the European Union. During 1999-2001, national denominations coexisted with the euro as physical circulating currencies and for denomination of financial instruments and transactions. The national currencies have irrevocable fixed conversion factors against the euro, based on the configuration of exchange rates when the euro was created.  The irrevocably fixed, six significant digit conversion factors of national currencies per euro are as follows: Austrian schilling 13.7603, Belgian franc 40.3399, Cyprus pound 0.585274, Estonian krooni 15,6466, Finnish markka 5.94573, French franc 6.55957, German mark 1.95583, Greek drachmas 340.750, Irish pound .787564, Italian lira 1,936.27, Latvian lat 0.702800, Lithuanian litas 3.45280, Luxembourg franc 40.3399, Maltese lira 0.4293, Netherlands guilder 2.20371, Portuguese escudo 200.482, Slovak koruna 30.1260, Slovenian tolar 239.640, and Spanish peseta 166.386.

Reserves are defined on a euro area-wide residency basis to include only positions with non-euro area residents. Claims denominated in euros are excluded from reserves.  The international reserves of the euro area per the Eurosystem statistical definition at the start of the monetary union (January 1, 1999) in billions of U.S. dollars were as follows: <i>Total Reserves minus Gold, </i>$269,140; <i>Foreign Exchange, </i>$235,103; <i>SDR holdings, </i>$6,982; <i>Reserve Position in the Fund, </i>$26,238; <i>Other Reserve Assets, </i>$820; <i>Gold, </i>$116,094; <i>Gold (million fine troy ounces), </i>403.778 ounces. <i>Gold (Eurosystem Valuation) (line 1and) </i>from January 1999 onward is revalued at market rates and prices at the end of each month.
